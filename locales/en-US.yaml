        StudyStorm application allows users to create collections of review cards and share them. 
        The creator of a classroom can share his collections to everyone or make the classroom private,
        by inviting only the users he/she wants to join the classroom. 
        The organization of the collections is similar to a folder system. 
        This allows cards to be grouped by topic, chapter, course unit, etc. 
        The community can rate the content they liked or not. 
        The collections with the most positive votes will be displayed on the homepage. 
        Since the cards are made by people, it is possible that there are errors in the answer of a card, or that there is a more relevant answer. 
        Users have the possibility to report a map with a better answer. 
        It is then the responsibility of the card creator to implement the change.
